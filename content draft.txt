Hi there! I'm Christoph Sachse, an Electrical Engineering/Computer Science (EECS) student at UC Berkeley, as well as a part time web developer and  full-time mathematical algorithms enthusiast interested mainly in highly scalable/parallelizable machine learning algorithms and bootstrapped statistical learning. My preferred tools inlcude Django, JQuery, MATLAB, and a large chalkboard, though I'm also familiar with other tools, such as whiteboards. Check out my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> for the whole shebang, or just scroll down a bit to see what I've been working on recently!
